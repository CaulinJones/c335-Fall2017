THe major difficulkties was not reading from the nunchuck , but handling the inputs which were different than  what we were used to. Working with the numbers and 
doing the math that properly draws the pixels o nthe screen. I learned that math is super powerful and most of these converssions of numbers
is our most powerful tool.


1. WE do not perform pin initialization in the f3d_accel and f3d_mag files because we are using the i2c communication to communicate with the devices, the i2c pins are initialized in the i2c_init function
and since we communicate with teh devices through i2c, i3c handles on transmiting the information from accel or mag to output.

2. i2c_nucckuck_read takes a nuncuku struct pointer and the other takes uint8_t device, uint8_t* buffer, uint16_t numbyte

3.jx - joystick x value
  jy - joystick y value
  ax - accelerometer x value
  ay - accelorometer y value
  az - accelorometer z value
  c - c button inpute
  z - z button input
  
  
  
  4. It checks what the input value is from the element correspinding to the button input and checking what that input is, and setting the output to be as suck.
