1. Here we are setting the signal macros to represent when the protocal is ready t osend information, or if it is finished sending information.
IN SPI protocal we do that same thing, the pin must be set low in order to signal the machien to send bits.


2. A delay time requres less instruction to operate, a delay loop takes up more resources than a timer, so it is less efficient for a system
that may need those resources.


3. DMA alows for the direct movement of data from a devices such as a harddrive, to motherboard memory without the use of the microprocessor.
  IF we used DMA in our image application, the images could be loaded without using the processor to do so, and this would make our application much faster.
  
4. The File Allocation Table system uses a table structure to nest item in a certain format. Since the file format is known by the 
program reading the data, the program can follow the struction and will know how files are represented in the FAT to properly parse the data.
IF there is a mis-entry in the table, the format will be corrupted because the parser would not have the information it needs t find the next file in the system.


5. FAT32 offeres finer allocation grandulation versus FAT16. FAT32 also allows for larger amount of things in the root directory. 
  FAT16 is a more backward compatable format, but has size limits in some cases. 
  
  
  
  What I found most difficultin this lab was reading the pixel array from the bitmap correctly and also correctly processing the color values.
  The lab manual was vague, and my code seems to word, it just seems like I didnt know what was actually happening after I read theheader information.
  
  
  What I learned in this lab is that files have lots of extra metadata attached to them and also how to read that infor into a data structure.
