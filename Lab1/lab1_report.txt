I set up my iu github account with ssh authentications from a school machine 
. We also created a c program that prints "Hello World" every three seconds to the console. 
I then found my partner Cassidy and we made alteration to our c hello world program to make
a program that would make a new file on tick with the concol print. I then put both of the 
c programs on github with the git  commit push merge. We created the new file with the sprinf command.
We tried some other FILE commands like fopen but went with the configuration we have in the icebreaker.c.
I learned the correct way to put my files on github without a gui which was very beneficial to my success this semester.
