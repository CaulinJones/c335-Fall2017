C335 Final Project Report.txt



For the majority of the project Alex and I worked together on one machine most of the time. The part of the code that I wrote by myself
was the collision and the circle object. I wrote that on my laptop and Alex made some transformations to it for it to work with our existing code.
We had some great teamwork and commitment and there were no problems with our communication because we were working together for the whole project.



By far the biggest issue we had was with finding workign nunchuks. We spent so much time with our code not executing past nunchuckinit because the 
not working nunchuks would cause the issue. Also trying to not redraw over pixels for objects in our game. We had issues with overlapping
pixels that we did not want to overlap.



I learned really how a game executes and all of the building blocks. I think what I learned about graphics drawing really put into perspective 
how much you actually have to handle all of the little things to make a good final product with these boards. It was a lot of fun and really enjoyed the class as a whole.
