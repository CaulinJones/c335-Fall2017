There were not very many difficulties in this lab. We had a little bit of trouble getting the board to work on my lab partner's machine after it was working on my machien but we resloved this issue. I learned a lot about how to read inputs fro mthe board, also I learned about how to link header files and build modules with the drivers referencing.
