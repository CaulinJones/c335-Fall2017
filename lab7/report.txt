The main difficulties with this lab came from figuring out the tilt compinsation for the compass. Adjusting the display for the tilt was a tidius task .
I learned that you can access the device chips such as the accelerometer through multiple communication protocalls and in different ways.



1. NUmber of pins: 14 pins 
pin #   |   Name
1           Vdd_IO
2           SCL  
3           SDA
4           INT2
5           INT1
6           C1
7           GND
8           Reserved
9           DRDY
10          Reserved
11          Reserved
12          SETP
13          SETC
14          Vdd

Vdd= 2.5V

It is by the led board under the arm processor.


2. THe i2c protocall handles many diffferent devices on the Syts32, so we must write through the protocal to describe what feature we are wanting to
utiilze through i2c. We have to tell the system that we want to access the accelorometter because if the system can use both magnetometer and accelerometer
the only way it knowss which one we want to access is when we tell is which.

3. In this line of code we are reading from the accelorometer from the i2c,and casting the values to get them prepared for the output
and puting the values on to our accelorometer data array.

4. If the compass is moved around, the direction may be calculator for the magnatic north assuming a certian position, when the screen tils the reading needs to be componsated accordingly.
